The show actually just finished its 11th season, and sadly ended this November. This is my favourite show because I have been watching it since I was 8 and it is nostalgic for me. The last piece of media I chose is a movie called "This is the End." I have watched hundreds of movies throughout my life but this one, without fail, makes me laugh the most out of any movie I have seen, no matter how many times I watch it.';

One being customer service, I worked as a receptionist at Whitby Mazda for a summer and it really benefited my social skills and customer service skills. In the future if I need to talk with clients about code requirements, I have the means to do so respectfully and skillfully. The next skill I would like to dislpay is Web Design(mostly the colour coding parts, still trying to get the positioning down), I have taken a lot of interest in it, the last 2 years and I feel it is one of my strong suits out of all the coding I have done. It is something I actually enjoy doing, it is not something I would be forcing myself to do. The final skill I have is computer programming, I am aware of how broad computer programming is, but one of my skills is knowing a lot of different and various languages and easily switching between them. I am by no means a computer programming genius and I do not know everything there is to know, but during my Computer Programming course I found it fairly easy for myself to switch between languages while doing multiple assignments.';

The second picture is of my pc setup, this is where I spend most of my nights playing games with my friends or doing work, so I put it down as one of my hobbies! The third picture is of me playing tennis in the summer. This is one of my hobbies and something I enjoy, I have been playing tennis since I was around 7 years old. I played competitively for a long time, but I did end up quitting that part in grade 12. I met my best friend playing in Ajax and now we go out and play for fun!';
